## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup Checklist

### Step 1: Execute Schema
- [ ] Open Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Copy contents of `CREATE_HRM_SCHEMA.sql`
- [ ] Execute the script
- [ ] Verify no errors in execution

### Step 2: Verify Tables Created
Run this query to verify:
```sql
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE 'employee%' OR table_name LIKE 'leave%'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

Expected result (10 tables):
- [ ] employee_attendance
- [ ] employee_departments
- [ ] employee_leave_balance
- [ ] employee_leaves
- [ ] employee_payroll
- [ ] employee_performance
- [ ] employee_roles
- [ ] employee_schedules
- [ ] employees
- [ ] leave_types

### Step 3: Verify Default Data
```sql
-- Check leave types (should be 6)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leave_types;

-- Check departments (should be 7)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_departments;

-- Check roles (should be 6)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employee_roles;
```

Expected counts:
- [ ] 6 leave types
- [ ] 7 departments
- [ ] 6 roles

## üîê Permissions Setup Checklist

### Option 1: Grant HRM Access to Admin (Recommended)

```sql
-- Update your admin user (replace email)
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_app_meta_data =
  jsonb_set(
    COALESCE(raw_app_meta_data, '{}'::jsonb),
    '{permissions}',
    (COALESCE(raw_app_meta_data->'permissions', '[]'::jsonb) || '["access_hrm"]'::jsonb)
  )
WHERE email = 'admin@valant.com'; -- ‚Üê Replace with your admin email
```

Verify:
```sql
SELECT email, raw_app_meta_data->'permissions' as permissions
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'admin@valant.com';
```

- [ ] Permission granted to admin user
- [ ] Verified in database

### Option 2: Remove Permission Requirement (Testing Only)

Edit `src/App.tsx` line 940:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
{
  id: 'hrm',
  name: 'üë• HR Management',
  component: HRMManagement,
  description: 'Manage hospital staff, attendance, leaves, and payroll',
  permission: 'access_hrm'  // ‚Üê Remove this line for testing
}

// AFTER:
{
  id: 'hrm',
  name: 'üë• HR Management',
  component: HRMManagement,
  description: 'Manage hospital staff, attendance, leaves, and payroll'
}
```

- [ ] Permission requirement removed (if testing)
