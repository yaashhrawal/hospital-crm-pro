# IPD Billing Date Feature Test Plan

## Changes Implemented

1. **Added Billing Date Field to IPD Billing Section**
   - Location: NewIPDBillingModule.tsx line 1907-1916
   - Added a date input field labeled "Billing Date" in the billing header
   - The field uses the `billingDate` state variable

2. **Added Date Field to Deposit Section**
   - Location: NewIPDBillingModule.tsx line 2355-2363
   - Added a date input field for deposits
   - Allows backdating deposit entries

3. **Updated Transaction Creation**
   - IPD Bill Generation (line 1112): Now uses `billingDate` instead of `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]`
   - Deposit Creation (line 865): Now uses `billingDate` for transaction_date

## How to Test

### Step 1: Test IPD Billing with Custom Date
1. Navigate to the IPD Billing section
2. Select a patient
3. Change the "Billing Date" to a past date (e.g., yesterday)
4. Enter billing details and generate the IPD bill
5. Note the bill reference number

### Step 2: Test Deposit with Custom Date  
1. Go to the Deposit section
2. Change the date to a different past date
3. Add a new deposit for the patient
4. Save the deposit

### Step 3: Verify in Operations Section
1. Navigate to Daily Operations
2. Select the date you used for the IPD bill
3. Verify the IPD bill appears with correct amount and details
4. Select the date you used for the deposit
5. Verify the deposit appears with correct amount

### Expected Results
- IPD bills should appear in the operations section on the date selected during creation
- Deposits should appear on their selected dates
- The transaction_date in the database should match the selected billing date
- All transactions should be filterable by date in the operations view

## Database Verification Query
```sql
-- Check recent IPD transactions with their dates
SELECT 
  id,
  transaction_type,
  description,
  amount,
  transaction_date,
  created_at,
  payment_mode,
  status
FROM patient_transactions
WHERE hospital_id = 1
  AND transaction_type IN ('service', 'admission', 'deposit')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Key Files Modified
- `/src/components/billing/NewIPDBillingModule.tsx`
  - Lines: 1907-1916 (Billing date field)
  - Lines: 2355-2363 (Deposit date field)
  - Line: 1112 (IPD bill transaction_date)
  - Line: 865 (Deposit transaction_date)

## Technical Details
- The `billingDate` state is initialized with today's date
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO format)
- Transaction filtering in operations uses `transaction_date` field primarily
- Falls back to `created_at` if `transaction_date` is not available
