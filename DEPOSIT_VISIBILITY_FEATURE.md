# Deposit Visibility Feature Implementation

## Feature Summary
Deposits are now visible in both the IPD billing list and the Daily Operations section, appearing on the date they were created with proper visual distinction.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated IPD Bills Loading (`NewIPDBillingModule.tsx`)

**Function: `loadIPDBills()` (Lines 596-690)**
- Changed from loading only 'SERVICE' transactions to loading both 'SERVICE' and 'ADMISSION_FEE'
- Now loads deposits alongside IPD bills
- Added visual properties to distinguish between bills and deposits:
  - `display_type`: "IPD Bill" or "Deposit"
  - `display_icon`: "🧾" for bills, "💰" for deposits

**Key changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Only loaded SERVICE transactions
.eq('transaction_type', 'SERVICE')

// After: Loads both bills and deposits
.in('transaction_type', ['SERVICE', 'ADMISSION_FEE'])
```

### 2. Enhanced Bill List Display

**Visual Distinctions Added:**
- **Icons:** 🧾 for IPD bills, 💰 for deposits
- **Badges:** Blue badges for "IPD Bill", Green badges for "Deposit"
- **Reference numbers:** Both show with their icons
- **Enhanced view details:** Shows transaction type and payment mode

**Lines updated:**
- Lines 1547-1569: Main bill list table
- Lines 1761-1781: Detailed view table
- Lines 1211-1230: View bill handler with transaction type display

### 3. Updated Daily Operations View (`DailyOperationsView.tsx`)

**Transaction Type Mapping (Lines 123-148):**
- Maps database transaction types to display types:
  - `SERVICE` → `service` (displays as 🧾)
  - `ADMISSION_FEE` → `admission` (displays as 💰)
  - `CONSULTATION` → `consultation` (displays as 👩‍⚕️)
  - `ENTRY_FEE` → `entry` (displays as 🚪)

**Icon Updates (Lines 224-233):**
- Updated icons to match IPD billing:
  - `service`: 🧾 (IPD Bill)
  - `admission`: 💰 (Deposit)

### 4. Transaction Date Consistency

Both deposits and bills now use the `billingDate` field, ensuring:
- Deposits appear in operations on the date selected during creation
- Bills appear in operations on their billing date
- Both are filtered correctly by date in Daily Operations

## How It Works

### Creating a Deposit:
1. User selects a date in the IPD billing deposit section
2. User adds deposit amount and details
3. Deposit saves with `transaction_type: 'ADMISSION_FEE'`
4. Deposit uses the selected `billingDate` as `transaction_date`

### Viewing Deposits:
1. **In IPD Bill List:**
   - Shows alongside IPD bills
   - Green "Deposit" badge with 💰 icon
   - Same action buttons (View, Print, Delete)

2. **In Daily Operations:**
   - Appears in patient timeline with 💰 icon
   - Listed as "admission" type event
   - Shows on the date it was created

## Visual Guide

### IPD Bill List:
```
[🧾] IPD-123456    Patient Name    [IPD Bill] ₹5,000    [PAID]     2025-08-26
[💰] Y1067         Patient Name    [Deposit]  ₹2,000    [COMPLETED] 2025-08-26
```

### Daily Operations Timeline:
```
Patient Journey:
💰 10:30 AM - IPD Advance Payment - Receipt: Y1067 • CASH    ₹2,000
🧾 11:45 AM - IPD Bill - IPD-123456 | Room: ₹1000... • CASH  ₹5,000
```
