# Email Integration - Limitation & Solutions

## Current Situation

‚úÖ **Your code is working correctly!** The frontend allows entering any email address.

‚ùå **The limitation is from Resend API (Free Tier)**, not your code.

### What's Happening:
- When you try to send an email to any address other than `divyanshkwork@gmail.com`, Resend API blocks it
- This is a **security feature** of Resend's free tier to prevent spam
- Your code in `NewIPDBillingModule.tsx` and `useReceiptPrinting.tsx` already supports any email address

---

## Solution 1: Add More Verified Emails (Quick Fix)

### Steps to add verified emails in Resend:

1. **Login to Resend Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/login
   - Login with your account

2. **Navigate to Emails Section**
   - Click on "Emails" in the left sidebar
   - Or go to: https://resend.com/emails

3. **Add New Verified Email**
   - Click on "Add Email" or "Verify Email" button
   - Enter the email address you want to send to (e.g., `patient@example.com`)
   - Click "Send Verification Email"

4. **Verify the Email**
   - The recipient will receive a verification email from Resend
   - They need to click the verification link in that email
   - Once verified, you can send emails to that address

5. **Test**
   - After verification, try sending receipt/IPD bill to that email
   - Should work immediately

### Limitations of This Approach:
- ‚ùå You need to verify EVERY email address individually
- ‚ùå Not practical for patient emails (patients change frequently)
- ‚ùå Not scalable for production use
- ‚úÖ Good for testing with 2-3 fixed email addresses

## Solution 2: Verify Your Domain (Recommended for Production)

### Why Domain Verification?
- ‚úÖ Send to **ANY email address** without verification
- ‚úÖ Professional emails from your domain (e.g., noreply@valanthospital.com)
- ‚úÖ Better deliverability and trust
- ‚úÖ No per-email verification needed
- ‚úÖ Scalable for production

### Steps to Verify Your Domain:

#### Step 1: Get a Domain
If you don't have a domain:
- Purchase from: Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.
- Example: `valanthospital.com` or `valanthospital.in`
- Cost: ‚Çπ500-1000/year

#### Step 2: Add Domain to Resend

1. **Login to Resend Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains

2. **Click "Add Domain"**
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `valanthospital.com`)
   - Click "Add Domain"

3. **Get DNS Records**
   - Resend will show you DNS records to add:
     - SPF record (TXT)
     - DKIM record (TXT)
     - DMARC record (TXT)
   - Copy these records (don't close this page)

#### Step 3: Add DNS Records to Your Domain Provider

**Example for Namecheap/GoDaddy:**

1. Login to your domain provider
2. Go to DNS Management / DNS Settings
3. Add the records Resend provided:

   ```
   Record Type: TXT
   Host: @ (or your domain)
   Value: [SPF record from Resend]
   TTL: Automatic or 300
   ```

   ```
   Record Type: TXT
   Host: resend._domainkey (or value from Resend)
   Value: [DKIM record from Resend]
   TTL: Automatic or 300
   ```

   ```
   Record Type: TXT
   Host: _dmarc
   Value: [DMARC record from Resend]
   TTL: Automatic or 300
   ```

4. Save DNS records

#### Step 4: Verify in Resend

1. Go back to Resend dashboard
2. Wait 5-15 minutes for DNS propagation
3. Click "Verify Domain" button
4. If successful, status will change to "Verified" ‚úÖ

#### Step 5: Update Your Code

Once domain is verified, update your `.env` file:

```env
# Change from default Resend address
VITE_EMAIL_FROM=noreply@valanthospital.com

# Or use a custom name
VITE_EMAIL_FROM=receipts@valanthospital.com
```

Restart your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Solution 3: Upgrade Resend Plan (Alternative)

If you can't verify domain, you can upgrade Resend:

- **Free Tier**: Only verified emails (current limitation)
- **Pro Tier** ($20/month): 50,000 emails/month, domain verification included
- **Scale Tier** ($80/month): 1,000,000 emails/month
