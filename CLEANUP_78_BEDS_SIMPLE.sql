-- SIMPLE: Fix 78 beds issue in main database
-- This will clean up all duplicate beds and create exactly 40 beds

-- Step 1: Show current bed situation
SELECT 
    'BEFORE CLEANUP' as status,
    COUNT(*) as total_beds
FROM beds;

-- Step 2: Backup any patient data that might be lost
CREATE TEMP TABLE bed_backup AS
SELECT 
    bed_number,
    patient_id,
    ipd_number,
    admission_date,
    status,
    consent_form_data,
    clinical_record_data,
    progress_sheet_data,
    nurses_orders_data,
    ipd_consents_data
FROM beds 
WHERE patient_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 3: COMPLETELY REMOVE ALL BEDS
DELETE FROM beds;

-- Step 4: Create exactly 40 beds (1-40)
INSERT INTO beds (bed_number, room_type, status, hospital_id, daily_rate, tat_remaining_seconds, tat_status)
SELECT 
    i::TEXT as bed_number,
    CASE 
        WHEN i <= 10 THEN 'GENERAL'

    1000 as daily_rate,
    1800 as tat_remaining_seconds,
    'idle' as tat_status
FROM generate_series(1, 40) AS i;

-- Step 5: Restore patient data to the first occurrence of each bed
UPDATE beds 
SET 
    patient_id = backup.patient_id,
    ipd_number = backup.ipd_number,
    admission_date = backup.admission_date,

WHERE beds.bed_number = backup.bed_number;

-- Step 6: Verify the fix
SELECT
