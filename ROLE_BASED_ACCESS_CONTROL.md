# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive role-based access control system for the Hospital CRM application. The system allows different user roles to have specific permissions and access levels.

## User Roles

### 1. Admin
- **Full access** to all sections and features
- Can edit all patient records
- Access to operations section
- Can manage users and departments
- Default role for system administrators

### 2. Frontdesk
- ✅ **Full access** to dashboard
- ✅ **Full access** to patient entry
- ❌ **NO edit access** in patient list (Edit button hidden)
- ❌ **NO access** to operations section
- ✅ **All other sections** accessible without edit capabilities
- Perfect for reception staff who need to view and add patients but not modify existing records

### 3. Doctor
- Full access to patient management
- Can edit patient records
- Access to operations section
- Billing capabilities
- Medical service management

### 4. Nurse
- Patient care management access
- Limited billing access
- Operations section access
- Can edit patient records for care updates

### 5. Accountant
- Focused on billing and financial operations
- Limited patient access (read-only)
- Expense management
- Revenue dashboard access

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- Created `CREATE_USER_ROLES.sql` with comprehensive user role management
- Added user metadata support in Supabase auth system
- Implemented RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Created helper functions for role management

### Authentication System
- Updated `authService.ts` with new role types
- Added `isFrontdesk()` method for specific role checking
- Enhanced permission system with granular controls
- Backward compatibility with existing role systems

### UI Components
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Dynamically filters menu items based on permissions
- **Patient List**: Conditionally hides edit buttons for frontdesk users
- **Access Control**: Prevents unauthorized navigation to restricted sections

### Permission System
Each role has specific permissions:

```typescript
// Frontdesk permissions
'read_own_profile'
'read_patients'
'create_patients'
'read_appointments'
'read_bills'
'create_bills'
'write_bills'
'read_dashboard'
// NO 'write_patients' - can't edit existing patients
// NO 'access_operations' - can't access operations section
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run these scripts in order:
1. CREATE_USER_ROLES.sql        -- Sets up the role schema
2. CREATE_FRONTDESK_USER.sql    -- Creates test users
```

### 2. Create Users in Supabase
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Users
2. Create users:
   - **Frontdesk**: `frontdesk@hospital.com` / `frontdesk123`
   - **Admin**: `admin@hospital.com` / `admin123`

### 3. Apply User Roles
Run the SQL from `CREATE_FRONTDESK_USER.sql` to set roles and metadata.

## Testing the System

### Login as Frontdesk User
- Email: `frontdesk@hospital.com`
- Password: `frontdesk123`
- **Should see**: Dashboard, Patient Entry, Patient List (no edit), Billing, etc.
- **Should NOT see**: Daily Operations menu item
- **Should NOT see**: Edit buttons in patient list

### Login as Admin User
- Email: `admin@hospital.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- **Should see**: All menu items and all functionality

## Security Features

1. **Client-Side Protection**: UI elements hidden based on roles
2. **Server-Side Protection**: Database policies enforce access control
3. **Permission Granularity**: Fine-grained permission system
4. **Role Inheritance**: Support for role hierarchies
5. **Audit Trail**: User actions tracked with role context

## Files Modified

### Core Authentication
- `src/services/authService.ts` - Added frontdesk role and permissions
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with new role methods
- `src/services/dataService.ts` - Updated role type casting

### UI Components
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Permission-based navigation
- `src/components/ComprehensivePatientList.tsx` - Conditional edit buttons

### Database Scripts
- `CREATE_USER_ROLES.sql` - Complete role schema
- `CREATE_FRONTDESK_USER.sql` - User creation script

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Security**: Users can only access what they need
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Frontdesk can't accidentally modify patient records
3. **Clear Separation**: Different roles for different responsibilities
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add new roles and permissions
5. **Audit Compliance**: Role-based access helps with regulatory requirements

## Future Enhancements

1. **Department-Based Access**: Limit access by medical departments
2. **Time-Based Permissions**: Restrict access during certain hours
3. **Advanced Audit Logging**: Track all user actions by role
4. **Role Management UI**: Admin interface to manage user roles
5. **Multi-Hospital Support**: Role isolation per hospital facility

The system is now ready for production use with proper role-based access control!
